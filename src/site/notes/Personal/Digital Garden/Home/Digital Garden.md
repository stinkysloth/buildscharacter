Kicking off my 'Digital Garden' experiment. 

Back in the mid-2000's, I started a blog, as was fashionable at the time, and had a massive audience of 4 people...my mother, father, brother and an ex-girlfriend that liked to keep tabs on me. It was filled with the mundane "This is what I did today, this is what I plan on doing tomorrow" type posts that were written by a young man, fresh out of college who was far from wise to the ways of the world. 

Fast forward 20 years, I've grown into a father, husband, a working professional, and someone with quite a few more nuanced and formed ideas about the world. The internet has shifted away from being a personal playground of blog posts on Tumbler toward, for better or worse, a more curated and refined on-line experience. 

The [[Personal/Digital Garden/Content/Obsidian/definition of a digital garden\|definition of a digital garden]] isn't something that I made up or have even been plugged into for very long, but when I first discovered the approach to capturing knowledge, thoughts, wisdom, and random junk from your days, it resonated with me. I used Evernote as a brain dump for the better part of the last decade and have recently moved over into the wonderful world of [[Personal/Digital Garden/Home/Obsidian\|Obsidian]], which if you haven't checked it out or given it a try, it's a fantastic way to spend a rabbit-hole of a Saturday. 

So with that, I present, the Digital Garden of [[Personal/Digital Garden/Content/Buildscharacter\|Buildscharacter]].
