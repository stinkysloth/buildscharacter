Holy Frick! 11labs quality and fast speed TTS finally all local!

Wow this post blew up! Just wanted to point out:
The repo below isn't mine, I have an audio sample on my fork, in stall from kanttouchthis, their repo is compatible with windows now.

This is the extension I'm referencing:
https://github.com/kanttouchthis/text-generation-webui-xtts

I got it working on a windows installation, here is an issues for more information:
https://github.com/kanttouchthis/text-generation-webui-xtts/issues/3

Two things to note* obsolete now:


1. reference the code change to fix the auto play issue if you are having one.

2. and very importantly, I think this is a windows only thing, change the install folder (in the extensions directory) from 

text-generation-webui-xtts

to

text_generation_webui_xtts

It totally works as advertised, it's fast, you can train any voice you want almost instantly with minimum effort.

Abide by and read the license agreement for the model.

**Edit I guess I missed the part where the creator mentions how to install TTS, do as they say for the installation.

Example of output, took about 3 seconds to render after the ai had finished the text.
