"It builds character"

A common expression and something that my younger self used to proclaim to fellow teenagers that were griping about something. 

I don't know how it came into my vernacular in the past, but for many years, it was a refrain that I said to my peer group. It became a running-joke, as to most oft-repeated things, among my friend group, so when the time came back in the mid-2000's to pick a domain, I found it available and the rest is history. 

Over the course of the years, I've not really put it to very good use, as it's generally able to be tracked back to my name and I tend to be pretty private on the internet. 

For many years, the only inhabitant of the page was this very questionable interaction between a cat and a sloth. Not really sure what my younger self was thinking.
