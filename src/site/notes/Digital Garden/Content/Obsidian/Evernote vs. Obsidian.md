## Purpose
Trying to evaluate if Obsidian can easily replace my Evernote usage. I will catalog my use cases and create example notes of the types of content and uses I have. 

#### Use Cases
* ##### Sync
	* [[Digital Garden/Content/Obsidian/Obsidian Sync\|Obsidian Sync]] seems to be the easiest option and once I've committed to Obsidian, I will pay for it. 
* ##### [[Audio Journal\|Audio Journal]]
* ##### [[Bills\|Bills]]
	* [[Bills\|Bills]] - It didn't handle moving over the encrypted note... not surprising. Not that big a deal. Can decrypt them easily enough, but can Obsidian be used as a [[password vault\|password vault]]?
		* Meh. Used [[Meld Decrypt\|Meld Decrypt]] and it "works" but not well for my use case. Would need to switch to using an actual password vault, which isn't a terrible thing and I already pay for one. 
* ##### [[Daily Notes\|Daily Notes]] 
	* I know this is robustly supported. Probably even better ones out there. If I were to incorporate using [[Todoist\|Todoist]] into my life, I could use a [Plugin](https://github.com/Ledaryy/obsidian-todoist-completed-tasks/blob/master/docs/ADVANCED.md) to sync it. From what I have been reading, that doesn't seem necessary and is likely overly complex. 
	* ##### [[Tasks\|Tasks]]
		* **Use Cases**
			* Capture tasks from within notes, such as meetings
			* Categorize tasks based on their purpose
			* View what tasks I have to-do broken down by purpose
			* Capture which tasks I completed on which day 
			* Nice to have: Monthly Completed tasks List
			* Nice to have: Reoccuring tasks
* ##### [[Remarkable\|Remarkable]] Integration
	* Evernote doesn't do this particularly well. 
	* Should be able to sync notes directly into Obsidian from Remarkable to better make use of the paper substitute. 
* Nested Folders
	* I just realized that Obsidian can have Nested folders.
