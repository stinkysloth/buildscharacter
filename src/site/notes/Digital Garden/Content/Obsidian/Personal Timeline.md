For a long time, I've had the idea of making a personal timeline. I've been looking into using Obsidian for this, as Obsidian falls neatly into the programmatic creation of a timeline, but allows for personal privacy that a personal timeline needs. 

There are a few areas that I think a personal timeline comes in handy... simple things like capturing milestones like weddings, events attended, jobs gained and lost, but also allows for easily looking up what happened in a given year. I don't know yet how and where I'll include this into my personal workflow, but it's something fun to investigate, which is what I'm doing.

To render a timeline in a note:

1. Add the `timeline` tag to the note, either in the YAML frontmatter or somewhere else.
2. Create a `timeline` code block or a timeline HTML comment for static rendering.

### Using a Timeline code block for dynamic rendering

Create the following code block where a timeline is to be inserted:

[![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Darakah/obsidian-timelines/main/images/example_1.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Darakah/obsidian-timelines/main/images/example_1.png)

## Timeline Event Properties

Timeline events must specify the following:

- a valid date, YEAR-MONTH-DAY-MINUTES (check info section below for more details)
- a valid class, specifically `ob-timelines` must be specified.

All other fields are optional.

Invalid timeline events will be skipped.

A timeline entry can be created using a `<span></span>` or `<div></div>` tag, with the following attributes:

```html
<span 
	  class='ob-timelines' 
	  data-date='2000-10-10-00' 
	  data-title='Another Event' 
	  data-class='orange' 
	  data-img = 'Timeline Example/Timeline_2.jpg' 
	  data-type='range' 
	  data-end='2000-10-20-00'> 
	A second event!
</span>
```

Timeline span and div entries (.ob-timelines class) are hidden in preview by default, however, if you wish to display content, try a snippet like this:

```css
/* Render the ob-timelines span or div elements as inline blocks that use an italic font */
.ob-timelines {
  display: inline-block !important;
  font-style: italic;
}
/* Use the before pseudo element to display attributes of the span or div */
.ob-timelines::before {
  content: "🔖 " attr(data-date) ": " attr(data-title) ". ";
  color: lilac;
  font-weight: 500;
}
```

Using the above snippet, a span like this:

```html
<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='1499-03-28-00' data-title="An example"></span>
```

would be rendered as:

#### Dates

The most important and essential info for the timeline entry is the date. Timeline entries can be used for fantasy timelines, leading to a simplified set of rules for valid dates.

A valid date is specified as `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-HOUR`.

- All four segments must be present.
- Each segment can contain only numbers, but can be any length.
- The YEAR (first segment) can be negative: `-123-45-678-9` is a valid date.

Rightmost-segments containing only zeros will be omitted when the timeline is generated, for example:

- `2300-02-00-00` will display as `2300-02`
- `2300-00-00-00` will display as `2300`

##### [](https://github.com/Darakah/obsidian-timelines#event-sorting)Event sorting

Event sorting is performed by converting the date into a number. For fantasy calendars, you may need to pad months, days, or hours with zeros to ensure sorting works properly.

- `2300-02-00-00` is sorted as `2300020000`
- `-234-02-00-00` is sorted as `-234020000`

For statically generated timelines, events that occur at the same time are grouped, and are either prepended or appended to a list based on your timeline sorting preference.

### [](https://github.com/Darakah/obsidian-timelines#title)Title:

- Optional
- If a title is not specified the name of the note will be used

### [](https://github.com/Darakah/obsidian-timelines#description)Description:

- Optional
- If a description is not specified an empty section will be shown

### [](https://github.com/Darakah/obsidian-timelines#background-image)Background Image:

- Optional
- If an image is not specified no image will be shown (just text)
- If an invalid url is given, an empty black section will be seen for that note card
- Currently only `http` & `absolute local path` will render. Obsidian release `v0.10.13` blocked obsidian links for background images.

### [](https://github.com/Darakah/obsidian-timelines#css-class)CSS Class:

- Optional
- Adds the applied css class to the note card associated with the timeline entry
